# Genetic algorithm optimization of start weights in                       a neural network

This program is an university project, which focus on combination of the genetic algorithms and neural networks. The program realized idea of finding very good weights and biases for neural network, and start teaching NN with them. Thanks to usage of GA in purpose of finding good initial weights for NN, time and number of epochs in which NN will achieve classification accuracy over 90% is smaller.
